Teallach is a Desktop Environment (DE) trying to offer a blend of speed, style
and substance. It is inspired by [crunchbang], [bunsenlabs] and [deadbang].
The primary aim of the Teallach project is to produce a stable setup, offering
the best possible out-of-the-box [labwc] experience.

It is thought of as a micro-DE (ÂµDE) because it is smaller and more austere
compared with other commonly known DEs.
