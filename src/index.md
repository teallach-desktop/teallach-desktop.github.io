Teallach is a Desktop Environment trying to offer a blend of speed, style and
substance. It is inspired by [crunchbang], [bunsenlabs] and [deadbang], although
is not itself a distribution but a mere interface layer between the compositor
and user. As it is much smaller and more austere compared with other commonly
known DEs, it is thought of as a micro-DE (ÂµDE). The primary aim of the Teallach
project is to produce a stable setup, offering the best possible out-of-the-box
labwc experience.
