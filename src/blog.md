So far, teallach consists of only some scaffoldnig. A rough shape is starting
to emerge.

This week saw the addition of a rudimentary wallpaper setter client - in a mere
129 lines of python code. We do not need too many helper apps like that, but
setting the wallpaper by editing files manually is just hard work.

```
teallach-nitrogen
```

We use the Kvantum theme `KvGnomeDark`.

## Post-installation Script

It is not great for a packaged program to install files in `$HOME`. So when
considering how teallach files should be organised, it seems like a
post-installation script is required to write files like
`~/.config/labwc/autostart`

```
teallach-welcome
```

As this matures, we may consider using the `--merge-config` flag and use a
script to start the compositor which first adds `/usr/share/teallach/...` into
`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`.

## Theming

Let us favour Server Side Decoration.

## Menu

We have a menu! It is generated by [teallach-menu], which coverts a
human-readable menu format (example below) into openbox compliant XML.

```
item Browser firefox
item Terminal foot
item Tweaks labwc-tweaks

sepr

exec labwc-menu-generator -b -t foot

sepr

menu Preferences
  item "Edit rc.xml" "featherpad ~/.config/labwc/rc.xml"
  item "Edit autostart" "featherpad ~/.config/labwc/autostart"

menu Exit
  conf Reconfigure
  exit Logout
```

## Palette

I think this palette looks good. It is not too dissimilar to that of CrunchBang
and works fine with Adwaita Dark.

If we start with a bare Alpine Linux installation, how much glue is needed to
turn `labwc` into something that feels like a Desktop Environment?

`labwc` is running on Alpine 3.22 with only the following packages: `doas`,
`labwc`, `ttf-dejavu`, `seatd`, `mesa-dri-gallium`, `dbus`, `dbus-x11`,
`xwayland`.
